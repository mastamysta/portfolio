<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  The objective of writing this website was to pick up some of the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I ended up using JQuery and Bootstrap to simplify things which turned out to be extremenly useful for my blog website.

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>
  One section I was particularly happy with was the blurring effect of the thumbnails in the projects section. Looking back its an extremely simple effect but that reactive quality makes the site feel more professional.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
  With hidsight, this page seems pretty rough around the edges, but it certainly served as a good introduction to front end development. This was pretty much my 'Hello World' for CSS, HTML and Javascript.
